# Levis
## Kubernetes Manifest Generator


**Levis** is Kubernetes Manifest Generatoror for creating Kubernetes
applications and reusable abstractions using familiar programming languages and
rich object-oriented APIs. Levis generates pure Kubernetes YAML - you can use
Levis to define applications for any Kubernetes cluster running anywhere.

This is an early-stage, experimental project built with ❤️ by KubeOps Skills. We encourage you to [try it out](#getting-started), [leave feedback](#help--feedback), and [jump in to help](#contributing)!
